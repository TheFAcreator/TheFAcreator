- I already have 4 games on my mind and I'm looking forward to creating them!
- I have been working on the design and idea of a game for 6 years.
- I have experience in:
  - C# (over 2 years) - fluent with complex topics like *generics, threads, pointers, preprocessor directives, delegates, reflection, iterators, comparators*
  - Regular Expressions
  - Javascript, Typescript & React
  - HTML (briefly)
  - JSON (use for fake data)

Console.WriteLine("It's the FA creator!");
