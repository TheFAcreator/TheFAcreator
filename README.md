- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheFAcreator
- 👀 I’m interested in Game Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity, C# (already mastered but still more could be learnt), HTML.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
---
- I already have 4 games on my mind and I'm looking forward to creating them!
- I have been working on the design and idea of a game for 6 years.
- I have experience in:
  - C# (over 2 years) - fluent with complex topics like *generics, threads, pointers, preprocessor directives, delegates, reflection, iterators, comparators, streams, unit testing (via nUnit)*
  - Regular Expressions
  - Javascript, Typescript & React
  - HTML (briefly)
  - JSON (use for fake data)

```
Console.WriteLine("It's the FA creator!");
